    "description": "NewsPuzzles: Like a daily crossword (but simpler) and based on today\u2019s NEWS!  . . . . . . . What a concept! Plus a daily crickler crossword and vocabulary puzzle. . . . . .\r\n\r\nCricklers are a new type of word puzzle.  We set out to totally re-invent the crossword puzzle for the computer age.  Traditional crossword puzzles are incredibly successful but they have several serious drawbacks: (1) They are difficult to construct, (2) Most words are short and often silly -- chosen only because they fit, (3) Matching clues to numbers is a distraction, and (4) A given puzzle is usually either too easy or too hard. . . . . .\r\n\r\nCricklers solve all of these problems while retaining the essence and feel of a traditional crossword puzzle.  Cricklers adapt: they become easier or harder depending on the skill of the solver.  Words are chosen by the designer -- the computer takes care of fitting them together.  Clues and answers sit side by side. . . . . . \r\n\r\nCricklers use upper and lower case correctly and can handle numbers, symbols, and accented letters. You can see which letters are vowels, and you get a reassuring sound when you complete a clue correctly.",
